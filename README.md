2. Checked NULL values in important columns.
3. Identified incomplete records containing `NA`.
4. Removed 68 incomplete restaurant records.
5. Created a numeric `rating_numeric` column.
6. Converted unavailable ratings (`--`) to NULL.
7. Created a numeric `cost_numeric` column.
8. Converted cost values such as `₹ 250` into `250`.
9. Created a numeric `rating_count_numeric` column.
10. Converted values such as `1K+`, `5K+`, and `10K+` into numeric values.
